# sd-project1

Project 1 for the course of Sistemas Distribu√≠dos (Distributed Systems) at Universidade de Aveiro.

## Heist to the Museum

### Run the project with IntelliJ

1. Open the project with IntelliJ
2. Simply run the project
3. The logging file can be passed as an argument to the program

### Run the project with [run.sh](run.sh)

1. Open a terminal in the project's root directory
2. Compile the project beforehand
3. Run the the bash script `./run.sh [...args]`

The [**run.sh**](run.sh) script accepts the following arguments:
`run.sh [-h] [-r <repetitions>] [-p <path-binaries>] [-l <logging-file>]"` where:
* `-h` prints the help message
* `-r <repetitions>` sets the number of times the program will run
* `-p <path-binaries>` sets the path to the binaries from the compilation*
* `-l <logging-file>` sets the name of the logging file

*The path to the binaries is mandatory. These binaries are the .class files generated by the compilation of the project. If the project was compiled with IntelliJ, the path to the binaries is most likely `out/production/sd-project1/`.
